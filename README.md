## Development

### Using Vagrant (Best for new contributors)
1. Clone this repository to your desired place. 
   If you are also new to Git, try GitHub client ([Windows](https://windows.github.com/), [Mac](https://mac.github.com/)).
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) onto your system.
3. Open Terminal. 
   Hit Windows-R, type `cmd` then hit Enter if you are on Windows.
4. `cd [repo directory]` to reach the repository.
5. Run `vagrant up`. This may take a while (approx. 15â€“30 minutes) as it needs to download a virtual machine image and all the other required packages to run.
6. Run `vagrant exec grunt`. You will see the output will stay at `watch`.
7. Open a web browser, go to `localhost:8000` and you can see the current website. 
   You can modify the website contents and the changes will be reflected in second.
8. To stop the script, go back to the terminal and hit Ctrl-C. 
   Also if you want to stop the virtual machine running, run `vagrant halt`.


### Using Node.js directly
1. Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) in your system.
2. Install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/)
    `sudo npm install -g grunt-cli`
3. Run `npm install` in repo directory.
4. Run `grunt` in repo directory, the output will stay at `watch` task.
5. Open `localhost:8000`, modify and see the [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) result.



## Static Pages Local Installation

It's easy to set up static pages including home page, event pages, contribution pages, etc. 

Only one requirement: 
* SSI (Server Side Include)-supported web server with Virtual Hosts enabled

### Apache 2

To enable SSI on Apache is very easy on most OSes. 
Take Ubuntu for example, just execute `a2enmod include`. Then you have a SSI-ready Aapche.

The 2nd step is adding virtual host configs to your Apache configuration:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName moztw.yourdomain.name
        ServerAdmin admin@yourdomain.name

        DocumentRoot /path/to/this/repo/
        <Directory /path/to/this/repo>
            Options FollowSymLinks Includes
            AllowOverride All
            Order allow,deny
            allow from all
            Require all granted
        </Directory>
    </VirtualHost>

Restart Apache and open your browser, open *http://moztw.yourdomain.name*. You should now see the MozTW homepage.

### Nginx

Example of site configuration with SSI module enabled:

    server {
      listen 80;
      server_name moztw.yourdomain.name;

      location / {
        root /path/to/this/repo/;
        ssi on;
        ssi_types text/shtml;
        index index.html index.htm index.shtml index.php;
      }
    }

Note that we're not running Nginx server online for now, you might encounter some problems,
e.g., _.htaccess_ feature was not supported.
